# Angular Test Task
The main goal of the task is to show your skills in the best way possible. Please use proper styling and animation.

Quality of code (proper logic, structure and style) is very important, and we should be able to run your code

## Task

1. Create the new Angular 7+ project using angular CLI
2. Create a page with a paginated users list. You should create custom components for the list itself and the particular user card. The user list should be horizontally centered.
3. Use the following HTTP endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users?page={page} to get the cards data, which includes avatar image, first_name, last_name and id for the card. Single user can be requested via this endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.
4. On click of the card, it should direct to a new page with information about this card.
5. On each individual card page a back button should be present.

## Important notes
1. Use angular router for navigation between two pages.
2. Use random colors, fonts - as per your choice.
3. SCSS for any styling

## Optional
Introduce proper caching to avoid additional requests.
